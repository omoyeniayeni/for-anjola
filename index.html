                  <P>"It will end in celebration! Your efforts will be crowned! 
I pray that God grants you clarity of mind, focus, and understanding as you study. I pray you are led to the right stuff to read, and that you retain the information you need. I pray that God gives the confidence and self-assurance you need to keep going. You will succeed in this exam... not because we want you to, but because you deserve to and God has made it so. "</P>
