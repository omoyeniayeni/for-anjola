                  <P>Surrender all your worries and anxieties to God. I pray that God calms your mind and eases your heart as you begin your exam today. I pray that you are able to stay focused and clear-headed and free of all fear and external pressure. We are all praying for you. God is present with you... guiding you through the journey of this exam. Go in with a peaceful mind! Anjola 1 - 0 Pediatrics</P>
