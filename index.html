                  <P>So close! This time next weekend, look who's gonna be flexing. As you prepare for the last round of the exam, I pray that you continue to be motivated and encouraged and that you have the clarity of mind as you study. Difficult concepts, hard-to-understand the materials, those things that just refuse to stick, May God grant you the ability to understand and recall them all. I hope you believe that this is going to end in praise because me I absolutely do!</P>
