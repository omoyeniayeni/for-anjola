                  <P>Guy, I deleted tik tok and instagram thinking I'll be more focused. But hehe I have just been playing games up and down. Don't be like me :) I pray you have the strength to ignore distractions, and the stamina to overcome tiredness. And when you need to rest and take a break, I pray you are surrounded by calmness and serenity. You've got this.</P>
